# NN_Scratch
- This repo contains the basic principles of Neural Networks.
- It is based on the material and theory found in the book  Neural Networks and DeepLearning Michael Nielsen (Nielsen, M. A. (2015). Neural networks and deep learning (Vol. 25, pp. 15-24). San Francisco, CA, USA: Determination press.)
- All .py scripts can be found in the mentioned book.
- The plus of this repository is that all the scripts were organized according to kedro project's structure.
- This repository's sole purpose is to provide a clear resource for gaining a understanding of neural networks built from scratch.
